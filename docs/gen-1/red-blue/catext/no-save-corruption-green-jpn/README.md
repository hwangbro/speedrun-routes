# Pokémon Green (JPN) Any% No Save Corruption

**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

## Before Starting

- Note that there are two versions of Pokémon Green (JPN): 1.0 and 1.1.
- **Release 1.0** is the optimal version for this category. 
> If you are using release 1.1, please note that in order to activate the Select Glitch you must open your menu in route 1 navigate to items, slot 2 and press select on Oak's Parcel. After this you play normal, besides skipping this first step upon getting an encounter. Ignore this note if you are able to run on Release 1.0. 

## Before doing a new run

- Clear the save data by pressing Up + Select + B on the title screen and then toggling Down to say Yes. 
- If playing on Emulator, either Hard Reset before each individual attempt or capture the entire emulator border in order for the run to be valid.
- On the New Game screen press Down and A to enter the Options menu.
- Toggle the first setting to the left and the second setting to the right.
> This sets Options to Fast Text Speed and Battle Animations Off, respectively. 

## Intro

Name both yourself and your rival the **first default name** by clearing the preceding text box with B and buffering Down and A.

## Before Rival fight

- Get the PC Potion. 
> This can be done quickly buffering a B press immediately after talking to the PC to clear the first instant text box, then mash A until the Potion is being withdrawn, and lastly mash B (and hold right) to exit the PC.
- This Potion is required to set up [Dokokashira Door Glitch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dokokashira_door_glitch). 
- Exit the house and walk into Route 1 to trigger the cut scene.
- Choose the third ball to obtain Bulbasaur and do not nickname it. 
> Buffer dex entry with B, press A (confirm choice), mash B (no nickname)

## Rival Fight

- Spam Tackle, which is the first move.
> Losing the fight is the fastest outcome, but winning is also okay to continue. 

## Oak's Parcel

- Exit Oak's Lab, travel up Route 1, and enter the Viridian City Mart to obtain Oak's Parcel.
> Run away from all encounters on the way up. Run is the option in the bottom right corner of the in-fight menu. 
- Exit the mart, enter Route 1, and continue back towards Pallet Town.

## Glitch Setup

- While walking down Route 1 either walk the [optimal path](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#60/198/DDDLLDDDDDDDRDDDDDDDDDDDDRRRDDLDDDDDDDDDDDUD) that yolos 3 tiles of grass or take the [safer path](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#60/198/DDDLLDDDDDDDRDDDDDDDDDDRRRRRRRDDDDDDLLDDLLLDDDDDDDUD) that hops the ledge to avoid any extra grass.
- When you get an encounter, take note of which tile it was on and immediately follow the steps listed below. 
> Always walk down the right side of the grass into Pallet Town and, if necessary, stall for an encounter up and down between these [two tiles](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/233/U).    

## Encounter & Glitch Activation
> For step 1 below after entering items you can play more safely by carefully toggling down onto the second item (Oak's Parcel), then pressing Select, and then pressing B. This avoids the chance of accidentally double inputting (landing you on Cancel) or accidentally selecting the first item (the Potion). 

- Buffer Right, hit A into Items, hit both Down and Select, buffer B to backout.
- Buffer Down and Left, hit A into Pokémon, press A on Bulbasaur, buffer B to backout.
- Buffer Up, hit A into fight, buffer B to backout.
- Buffer Down and Right, hit A to run away.    

## First Warp

> Note that if you got your encounter on the **1st Yolo Tile** then we must [take 2 extra steps](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/220/DDLLDDDDRDDDDDDDDD) before going down the right side grass to Pallet Town. 

- In Pallet Town walk [past Oak and to the right wall](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/236/DDLDDRRRRRRRR), walk [to the left wall](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#68/240/LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL), and walk [towards the entrance to Rival's House](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#51/240/RRRRRRRRRRR).
- Then based off of which tile you had your encounter on either enter Rival's House (1) [immediately](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/240/RU), (2) after walking [one tile to the right of the door](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/240/RRLU), or (3) after walking to the [rightmost tile of the house](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/240/RRRLLU). 

  - [1st Yolo](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/220/S)   : immediately
  - [2nd Yolo](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/221/S)   : rightmost tile of the house
  - [3rd Yolo](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#62/222/S)   : immediately
  - [1st Normal](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/230/S) : rightmost tile of the house
  - [2nd normal](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/231/S) : immediately
  - [3rd normal](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/232/S) : one tile to the right of the door
  - [4th normal](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#61/233/S) : one tile to the right of the door

## Hall of Fame Warps

- Go right then down [into the top-right corner of the house](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#116/119/RRRD).
- Exit the guard house by walking [right](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=186#1/3/RRURRRR).
- Continue to the right following [this path](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#134/120/RRRDDRRRRRRDDDDRRRRRRRRRUUUURRRRRRRRU).
  - Right, down then right bordering the grass, down and directly through the first double hedge, right to Celadon.
  - Upon entering Celadon walk up right away, walk right when in line with the front of Celadon Mart, enter the Right door. 
- This warps you to a glitched-looking Hall of Fame Room and timing ends on the fadeout after the last text box is cleared. 

## Troubleshoot

- After pressing A on Bulbasaur there should be some glitched characters on the screen.
- If the game crashes or freezes when you run away from the battle, you must check that every step was followed.
- If you get a second encounter after activating the select glitch, then this is unlucky and th game will be soft-locked. In this case you must restart.
- If the glitch was activated properly, then upon entering Pallet Town you will see Oak's sprite next to your house.
- If you are warped to the wrong place after entering the Rival's house, then you may have taken too many or too few steps. 
- If you continue to have trouble, the best way to get help is to ask a question in the PSR Gen1-3 Discord Server [linked in this SRC Forum Post](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/forums/se2sp). Posting a video of your attempt with an input viewer is the best way to get help and this category is typically discussed in the #gen1-Japanese channel. 

## Notes

- You can use the runs on the leaderboard for reference [here](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnrbext?h=Any_No_Save_Corruption_RedGreen_JPN&x=rklv88rd). 
- Beginners may find this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dbtLOd13Zo) by Rosstafari helpful. Note that there are some small differences between the tutorial and these notes, but this is okay. There are several alternate paths to take to make the warps work that are not covered in this guide.
- This guide is largely based on Enderborn's [Pokemon Any% NSC (Green, JPN) notes](https://pastebin.com/p4kW6M0M).

## **GOOD RUN !**
