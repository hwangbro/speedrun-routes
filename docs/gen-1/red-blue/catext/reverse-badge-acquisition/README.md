# Red-Blue Reverse Badge Acquisition Routes

* [Charizard Route (Beginner Route)](charizard-route/)
* [Kadabeedrill Route (Fastest Route)](kadabeedrill-route/)

## What route do I choose?
- The Charizard route is recommended if you're first starting out. It was previously the fastest route so it gets into all the glitched menuing. The route can still be used by beginners because it does not require the difficult starter/extended manips.
- The Kadabeedrill route is the improvement over the Charizard route. It requires starter manip for its Brock Through Walls and uses an extended manip to catch two Pokemon. The route should be used if these manips are not an obstacle.
